In a constant-volume process, there is no work done, so the heat input is required only to increase the internal energy of the gas. Therefore, the heat input is less in a constant-volume process than in a constant-pressure process. However, the statement in option B is not correct, as the heat input per degree increase in temperature is not the same in processes for which either the pressure or the volume is kept constant.

Substituting this into the formula for surface charge density, we get $\\sigma = \\frac{q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} (4 \\pi D^{2})} = \\frac{q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} D^{2}}$. However, since the plane is grounded and infinite in extent, the charge density is actually zero everywhere except at infinity, where it must be zero to ensure that the total charge on the plane is equal to the point charge $-q$. Therefore, the correct answer is E, but with the constant $\\epsilon_{0}$ instead of $4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}$.",

In this case, the decay is happening through two different processes, $\\gamma$-emission and $\\beta$-emission. The overall decay rate is the sum of the decay rates for each process. The decay rate for $\\gamma$-emission is given by the inverse of its half-life, 1/24 minutes, and the decay rate for $\\beta$-emission is given by the inverse of its half-life, 1/36 minutes. The overall decay rate is the sum of these two rates, 1/24 + 1/36 = 1/14.4 minutes. Therefore, the half-life for the sample is the reciprocal of this decay rate, 14.4 minutes.",

        "The longest wavelength $x$-ray that can undergo Bragg diffraction in a crystal for a given family of planes of spacing $d$ is given by $\\lambda = 2 d \\sin \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle of incidence. Since we want the longest wavelength, we want the smallest angle of incidence, which occurs when $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$, so $\\theta = 60^\\circ$. Substituting this value into the equation, we get $\\lambda = 2 d \\sin 60^\\circ = 2 d \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\boxed{d\\sqrt{3}}$. Therefore, the answer is D. However, it is worth noting that the answer E is also sometimes given in textbooks, likely due to a mistake in the calculation or a misunderstanding of the Bragg equation.

        "The correct answer is E. The Bernoulli equation states that the total energy of a fluid element remains constant as it moves through a pipe, assuming no work is done by external forces. In this case, the energy before the constriction is given by $P_{0} / \\rho+\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_{0}^{2}$, and the energy after the constriction is given by $P_{0} / \\rho+\\frac{1}{2} \\rho\\left(v_{0} / 2\\right)^{2}$.

        "The correct answer is E. The Bernoulli equation states that the total energy of a fluid element remains constant as it moves through a pipe, assuming no work is done by external forces.

Since the radius of the pipe is smaller after the constriction, the velocity of the fluid must increase in order to maintain the same mass flow rate. This can be calculated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which relates the velocity to the radius and viscosity of the fluid. The final velocity can be shown to be $\\frac{3}{2} r v_{0} / r_{c}$, where $r_{c}$ is the radius of the constriction.

Therefore, the pipe must be designed to produce a fundamental frequency that is a little flat, and the next higher harmonic after the fundamental is $\\",
        "B. The next higher harmonic for a pipe closed at one end is given by the formula $f_n = n \\times f_1$, where $f_1$ is the fundamental frequency and $n$ is the harmonic number. For the next higher harmonic, $n=2$. Plugging in the values, we get $f_2 = 2 \\times 131 \\mathrm{~Hz} = 262 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. However, the answer choices do not include this value. Instead, the closest answer is $196 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, which is the frequency of the third harmonic ($n=3 \\times 131 \\mathrm{~Hz} = 393 \\mathrm{~Hz} / 2$). Therefore, the answer is B."

        "D. The increase in internal energy is greater when the pressure remains constant because work is done by the gas during the process. The work done by the gas is given by $P\\Delta V$, so for constant pressure, the work done is nonzero, and the internal energy must increase by an amount equal to the work done to maintain constant pressure. For constant volume, there is no work done, so the internal energy only increases due to the heat input. Since heat is required to increase the internal energy, the heat input is greater when the volume remains constant (option E), but the increase in internal energy is greater when the pressure remains constant (option D).",

        "D. The increase in internal energy is greater when the pressure remains constant because the gas does work on its environment in that case. The work done by the gas is given by $P\\Delta V$, so the increase in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, is given by $\\Delta U = \\Delta H = \\Delta U_{int} + P\\Delta V$. Since the work done is positive when the gas expands (i.e., when the pressure is less than the initial pressure), the increase in internal energy is greater when the pressure remains constant and the gas does work on its environment.",
        "D. The increase in internal energy is greater when the pressure remains constant because the gas does work on its environment during a constant pressure process.

        "D. The increase in internal energy is greater when the pressure remains constant because the gas does work on its environment during an isobaric process. This work comes from the energy that was not used to increase the internal energy of the gas, so the internal energy increase is smaller for an isobaric process than for an isochoric process. However, the heat input is greater for an isochoric process because no work is done, so the heat needed to achieve the same temperature increase is greater for an isochoric process. Therefore, the answer is D, but it's important to note that the heat input is greater for an isochoric process, not less as stated in option E.",
        "D. The increase in internal energy is greater when the pressure remains constant because the gas does work on its environment, which requires an input of energy. This is not stated directly in the question, but it is implied by the fact that $C_{p}$ is greater than $C_{\\nu}$.",

        "D. The increase in internal energy is greater when the pressure remains constant than when the volume remains constant. This is because, for a given heat input, the gas does more work when the pressure remains constant, which requires more energy. Therefore, the internal energy must be greater to account for the additional work done.",

        "D. The increase in internal energy of a gas is greater when the pressure remains constant than when the volume remains constant, which is why $C_{p}>C_{\\nu}$. This is because in a constant-pressure process, the gas does work on its environment, which requires an additional energy input to maintain the pressure. In a constant-volume process, there is no work done, so the heat input is required only to increase the internal energy of the gas. Therefore, the heat input is less in a constant-volume process than in a constant-pressure process. However, the statement in option B is not correct, as the heat input per degree increase in temperature is not the same in processes for which either the pressure or the volume is kept constant. Instead, the heat input is proportional to the temperature change and the amount of substance, but the Legendre transformation is needed to compare the specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume directly.",

        "E. The smooth, continuous X-ray spectra produced by rapidly decelerating electrons in the target metal of the X-ray tube are called bremsstrahlung, which is German for \"braking radiation.\" This radiation is produced when the electrons are deflected (or \"braked\") by the electric field of the atomic nuclei in the target material, causing them to emit radiation as they lose energy. This continuous spectrum includes X-rays of various energies, and the cut-off wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\min }$, is determined by the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons in the beam. The discrete X-ray lines are called characteristic X-rays and are produced when an inner electron transitions to fill a vacancy in a lower energy level, emitting a specific energy (wavelength) of X-ray radiation.",

        "The transfer function $G(\\omega)$ of the circuit is given by the ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage. It can be calculated by dividing the Fourier transform of the output voltage by the Fourier transform of the input voltage."

This is because in a constant-pressure process, the gas does work on its environment, which requires an additional energy input to maintain the pressure. In a constant-volume process, there is no work done, so the heat input is required only to increase the internal energy of the gas. Therefore, the heat input is less in a constant-volume process than in a constant-pressure process. However, the statement in option B is not correct, as the heat input per degree increase in temperature is not the same in processes for which either the pressure or the volume is kept constant. Instead, the heat input is proportional to the temperature change and the amount of substance, but the Legendre transformation is needed to compare the specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume directly.",

However, the question asks for the ground state electron configuration, which for phosphorus is actually $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{1}$. The mistake in the question is that it states that phosphorus has 15 electrons, when in fact it has 15 protons and 15 electrons. Therefore, the correct answer is A, as it is the electron configuration for neutral phosphorus.",

Since the radius of the pipe is smaller after the constriction, the velocity of the fluid must increase in order to maintain the same mass flow rate.

The final velocity can be shown to be $\\frac{3}{2} r v_{0} / r_{c}$, where $r_{c}$ is the radius of the constriction.

        "The correct answer is E. The Bernoulli equation states that the total energy of a fluid element remains constant as it moves through a pipe, assuming no work is done by external forces.

The potential energy is zero since the fluid is moving horizontally. The pressure energy is given by $\\frac{P}{\\rho}$, so the pressure before the constriction is $\\frac{P_{0}}{\\rho}$.
