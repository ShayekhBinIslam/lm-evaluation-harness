The thermal energy is given by the equation $E = k T$. The mean kinetic energy of electrons in metals is much larger than the thermal energy, so the mean kinetic energy of electrons in metals is many times the thermal energy. The degeneracy of the energy levels can best be used to explain this fact. The energy levels of electrons in metals are very closely spaced, and there are many more electrons than energy levels. This means that many electrons must share the same energy level, and the energy level is said to be degenerate. The degeneracy of the energy levels allows many electrons to have the same energy, and this increases the mean kinetic energy of the electrons.",

This means that the mean kinetic energy of electrons is much larger than the thermal energy. This can be explained by the fact that the energy levels of electrons in metals are highly degenerate, meaning that there are many more energy levels available for the electrons to occupy than in a non-degenerate system. This allows the electrons to have a higher mean kinetic energy, even at room temperature. The other options do not directly address the question of why the mean kinetic energy of electrons in metals is much larger than the thermal energy.",

At room temperature, this is much smaller than the kinetic energy of the electrons, which is given by the Fermi energy $E_F$. The Fermi energy is related to the density of states at the Fermi level, which is large due to the degeneracy of the energy levels. The Pauli exclusion principle also plays a role, as it limits the number of electrons that can occupy a given energy level.

The thermal energy is given by the equation $E = k T$. The mean kinetic energy of electrons in metals is much larger than the thermal energy, so the mean kinetic energy of electrons in metals is many times the thermal energy. The degeneracy of the energy levels can best be used to explain this fact. The energy levels of electrons in metals are very closely spaced, and there are many more electrons than energy levels. This means that many electrons must share the same energy level, and the energy level is said to be degenerate. The degeneracy of the energy levels allows many electrons to have the same energy, and this increases the mean kinetic energy of the electrons.",

        "C. The degeneracy of the energy levels\nSolution: The mean kinetic energy of electrons in metals at room temperature is about 10 eV, while the thermal energy $k T$ is about 0.025 eV. This means that the mean kinetic energy of electrons is much larger than the thermal energy. This can be explained by the fact that the energy levels of electrons in metals are highly degenerate, meaning that there are many more energy levels available for the electrons to occupy than in a non-degenerate system. This allows the electrons to have a higher mean kinetic energy, even at room temperature. The other options do not directly address the question of why the mean kinetic energy of electrons in metals is much larger than the thermal energy.",

At room temperature, this is much smaller than the kinetic energy of the electrons, which is given by the Fermi energy $E_F$. The Fermi energy is related to the density of states at the Fermi level, which is large due to the degeneracy of the energy levels. The Pauli exclusion principle also plays a role, as it limits the number of electrons that can occupy a given energy level.

The thermal energy is given by the equation $E = k T$. The mean kinetic energy of electrons in metals is much larger than the thermal energy, so the mean kinetic energy of electrons in metals is many times the thermal energy. The degeneracy of the energy levels can best be used to explain this fact. The energy levels of electrons in metals are very closely spaced, and there are many more electrons than energy levels. This means that many electrons must share the same energy level, and the energy level is said to be degenerate. The degeneracy of the energy levels allows many electrons to have the same energy, and this increases the mean kinetic energy of the electrons.",

This means that the mean kinetic energy of electrons is much larger than the thermal energy. This can be explained by the fact that the energy levels of electrons in metals are highly degenerate, meaning that there are many more energy levels available for the electrons to occupy than in a non-degenerate system. This allows the electrons to have a higher mean kinetic energy, even at room temperature. The other options do not directly address the question of why the mean kinetic energy of electrons in metals is much larger than the thermal energy.",

At room temperature, this is much smaller than the kinetic energy of the electrons, which is given by the Fermi energy $E_F$. The Fermi energy is related to the density of states at the Fermi level, which is large due to the degeneracy of the energy levels. The Pauli exclusion principle also plays a role, as it limits the number of electrons that can occupy a given energy level.
