The moment of inertia of a circular hoop about an axis through its center is $I=\\frac{1}{2} m r^{2}$, where $r$ is the radius.

Since the mass of the hoop does not affect the period of small oscillations, the ratio of the periods is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the pendulums. Since the diameter of $X$ is four times that of $Y$, the length of $X$ is also four times that of $Y$. Therefore, the period of small oscillations of $X$ is four times that of $Y$, so the period of small oscillations of $Y$ is $T / 4$. Answer: \\boxed{C}.",
        "\\boxed{D}. The period of small oscillations of a pendulum is given by $T=2 \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{l}{g}}$, where $l$ is the length of the pendulum and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the hoops are hanging on nails, they are essentially simple pendulums. The length of a pendulum is proportional to the diameter of the hoop, so the length of $X$ is four times the length of $Y$. Therefore, the period of small oscillations of $X$ is four times the period of small oscillations of $Y$, or $T / 4$."

Substituting the given values, we get $v^2/c^2 = 1 - (60 \\mathrm{~cm}/100 \\mathrm{~cm})^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $v/c = \\sqrt{0.64",

Substituting the given values, we get $v^2/c^2 = 1 - (60 \\mathrm{~cm}/100 \\mathrm{~cm})^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $v/c = \\sqrt{0.64",

The linear velocity of a planet in a circular orbit is given by $v=r \\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the angular velocity. The angular velocity is related to the orbital period by $\\omega=2 \\pi / T$. Therefore, $L=m r^{2}(2 \\pi / T)$. Since the orbits have the same radius, the ratio of the angular momenta is equal to the ratio of the masses, which is $L_{1} / L_{2}=m_{1} / m_{2}$. The ratio of the orbital periods is $T_{1} / T_{2}=3$, so the ratio of the angular velocities is $\\omega_{1} / \\omega_{2}=T_{2} / T_{1}=1 / 3$.

Substituting the given values, we get $v^2/c^2 = 1 - (60 \\mathrm{~cm}/100 \\mathrm{~cm})^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $v/c = \\sqrt{0.64",
