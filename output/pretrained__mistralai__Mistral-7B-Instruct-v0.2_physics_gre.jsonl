        "A. The structure of the periodic table is based on the arrangement of electrons in atomic orbitals, not on their spin. Spin is a fundamental property of elementary particles, and it plays a crucial role in the explanation of the anomalous Zeeman effect, the fine structure of atomic spectra, and the deflection of electrons in magnetic fields. The specific heat of metals, on the other hand, can be explained in terms of the electronic contribution to the thermal energy of the material, which is related to the density of states of the electrons in the conduction band. However, the spin of the electrons is an important factor in the explanation of the magnetic properties of metals and other materials.",

        "C and D. The photoelectric equation is derived under the assumption that light is absorbed in quanta of energy $E=h \\nu$ (D), and that electrons can only absorb or emit energy in discrete amounts, leading to the emission of electrons when the energy of the incident photon exceeds the work function of the material (C). The assumption that electrons are associated with waves of wavelength $\\lambda=h / p$ (B) is a separate concept from the photoelectric effect, and the assumption that electrons are restricted to orbits of angular momentum $n \\hbar$ (A) is a concept from quantum mechanics that is not directly related to the photoelectric effect. The assumption that light behaves like a wave (E) is also a separate concept that is not directly related to the photoelectric effect, but is important for understanding the wave-particle duality of light.",

If the relative phase of the sources is varied from 0 to $2 \\pi$ at a frequency of 500 hertz, which of the following best describes the effect, if any, on the interference pattern?\n\nA. It is unaffected because the frequency of the phase change is very small compared to the frequency of visible light.\n\nB. It is unaffected because the frequency of the phase change is an integral multiple of $\\pi$.\n\nC. It is destroyed except when the phase difference is 0 or $\\pi$.\n\nD. It is destroyed for all phase differences because the monochromaticity of the sources is destroyed.\n\nE.
